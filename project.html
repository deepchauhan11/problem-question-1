        <h1 class="h-primary">Welcome to Uttarakhand</h1>
        <p>In the Puranas, Uttarakhand was the ancient term for the central Indian Himalayas. Its peaks and valleys were known as Svarga loka: a temporary abode of the righteous, and the source of the Ganges. At that time, present-day Uttarakhand was also reportedly inhabited by rishis and sadhus.</p>
